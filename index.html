                I'm a motivated and driven individual with a keen interest in tech. I've worked various different roles within an array of industries over the years which has allowed me to develop strong
                interpersonal skills, attention to detail and become a good team worker. I'm self-taught and have worked as a C# .Net Developer commercially for 3 years. Part of how I achieved
                this is I like to spend a portion of my free time learning and skilling up through courses on pluralsight or udemy, then applying those skills to small personal projects.
