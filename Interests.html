                            I&#39;m a motivated and driven individual with a keen interest in tech. I&#39;ve worked various different roles within an array of industries over the years which has allowed me to develop strong
                            interpersonal skills, attention to detail and become a good team worker. I&#39;m self-taught and have worked as a C# .Net Developer commercially for 3 years. Part of how I achieved
                            this is I like to spend a portion of my free time learning and skilling up through courses on pluralsight or udemy, then applying those skills to small personal projects.

                            <div>
                                Currently one of my favourite things to do is train and workout, I love the incremental progression that you can see within yourself in your performance and physically.
                                I never used to enjoy any amount of physical activity but I've been on quite a weight loss journey the last 18 months and none of that would've been possible without starting to work harder and exercise.

                                <br />
                                It's hard work, and it's not always something I want to do but it always feels worth the effort afterwards.

                        </li>

                            <div>
                                It may seem a little cliché but I do really enjoy skilling up and improving my technical abilities in my spare time. Not much can compare to the sense of accomplishment that comes with learning a new skill or improving an existing one.

                                <br />
                                We only have a finite amount of time, so why not spend some of it trying to become the best you possibly can?

                            <div>
                                For a small portion of my life I worked as a chef, one of my favourite parts about being a chef was when you got to prepare your own meals (not just because the food was good).
                                I really enjoyed the creativity you could exhibit when preparing your own food that you didn't get the chance to while preparing meals from the set menu. You had a real opportunity to fuse different flavours and ingredients together to come up with something delicious and nutritious.

                            <div>
                                I do also enjoy sometimes to just sit down and play a video game to unwind after a taxing day, just relax and let myself get sucked into a virtual world.
